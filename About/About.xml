	<description>Automatically distributes things carried in the inventory of caravan members to pawn's inventories in accordance to their requirements set by the "Assign"-tab assignments (like medicine) and drug-policies when a caravan arrives on a map.
	
- For example:
Alice and Bob are in the same caravan. Both should carry 5 beer due to a drug policy assignment.
Alice has 1 beer in her inventory and Bob has 12 beer.
Once Alice and Bob's caravan enters a map, this mod will distribute Bob's beers by moving 4 of them to Alice's inventory.
Now Alice carries 5 beer and Bob carries 8 beer, both satisfying their drug policy requirement.

Everyone is happy! 
Until they die from an ambush of manhunting squirrels...</description>
